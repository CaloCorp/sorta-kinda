# Sorta Kinda

Fork, clone, install, test. You get it!


### Hints

* You can use the subtraction trick for the numbers, but don't. Do an if/else -1/1/0 setup for better learning.
* Feel free to do a helper function THEN the matching iteration function. Or in direct order of tests. Whatever makes sense to you!
* Remember that we care about TWO elements. Always have your helpers take in two elements and return based on their relation to each other.
* Remember that you can use `.slice()` to make a copy!
